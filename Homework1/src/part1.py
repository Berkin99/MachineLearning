# Part 1: Build a classifier based on KNN (K=3 for testing) using Euclidean distance.
# o You are expected to code the KNN classifier (including the distance function).
# o Report performance using an appropriate k-fold cross validation using confusion
# matrices on the given dataset.
# o Report the run time performance of your above tests
